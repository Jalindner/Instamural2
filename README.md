* Push your branch and changes to your Github repository
* Create a Pull Request to your cohort organization

### Code Review Workflow

1. Another team mate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github
2. You make the desired changes (using the [Pull Request Workflow](#pull-request-workflow))
3. Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made

**Team should choose who merges Pull requests: code writer or the reviewer.**
